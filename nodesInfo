What is Nodejs Streams?
	Streams are the Object that let us read data from source or write data to a destination in continuous fashion.In Node.js there are four types of streams --
	Streaming means listening musics or watching videos in 'real time' ,instead of downloading a file to your computer or watching it later.
		Redable -> Stream which is used for read operation.
		Writable -> Stream which is used for write operation.
		Duplex -> Stream which can be used for both read and write operation.
		Transform -> A type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on input.

Each type of Stream is an EventEmitter instance and throws several events at different instance of times.
Some of commonly used event are --> 
	data - This event is fired when there is data is available to read.
	end - This event is fired when is no more data to read
	error - This event is fired when there is error receiving or writing data.
	finish - This event is fired when all the data has been flushed to underlying system.

stream.pipe() -> method used to take a reddable stream and connect it to a writable stream.
